classdef AnimateCombined < handle
% Simple class that animates the ship angle and overall forces.
% It also shows the effect of all the thrusters individually.
% It combines the AnimateThrusters class with the AnimateForces class.
% This is done since there are some graphically issues associated with
% running these classes at the same time.
% Furthermore more functionality is added.
%
% The class depicts five plots:
% (1) Depiction of vessel and individually thruster forces.
% (2) Depiction of vessel and overall thruster force/momentum in surge, sway and yaw.
% (3) Depiction of vessel and overall environmental force/momentum in surge, sway and yaw.
% (4) Depiction of vessel and overall total force/momentum in surge, sway and yaw.
% (5) Depiction of lineplots for each thruster force generated.
